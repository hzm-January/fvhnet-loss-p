\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we have presented a MLP-based network to learn homography matrix parameters instead of fixed,
which can accurately unify the in/extrinsic parameters of front-facing cameras on different vehicles.
In order to supervise FVHNet, we have designed a loss function, called FVHLoss, to computed the loss between FVHNet outputs and ground truth.
Our method is robust against other methods with fixed homography matrix parameters.
